I could once more focus on the world around me, in the present, than lose myself in endless self-examination. I returned to Honduras to finish my senior year of high school, and I was ready to take it for all it was worth.

I was alive…</p><p>I created multiple social circles and made sure there was no overlap between them. Honduran society, whether spoken or not, is largely based on economic casts. I had the freedom to move between them, not just because of my family’s status but because nobody knew who I was. Truth is the further I went down the line the better the people I encountered, not always but most of the time.</p><p>Some nights are still a blur, others are the almost unbelievable stories I recall to entertain myself. I’m still surprised that I was able to live almost completely separate lives. Senior year flew by, and by the time I was headed to college my intentions had changed once more. I started thinking of what I would leave behind. I had considered the damage, emotional and physical, I had caused, but I didn’t want that to be the way I would be remembered. I struggled to clearly understand why I was even thinking about others, especially those that scarcely affected my day-to-day.</p><p>The optimism of a legacy was short lived. My darkness flooded me with nihilist thoughts, and the lack of purpose made it seem futile. Emotional setbacks led to introspection and before I realized what was happening I was consumed in darkness. Nothing seemed worthwhile, but there was a glimmer. Buried deep in my subconscious, lived a small long-forgotten thought: I can make a difference. It took years to understand that thought and figure out how I wanted to make a difference, but in my vast ocean of darkness there was a light; and for now, that was enough.</p><picture>
