This was the first time I realized how little time I had spent with my father my whole life. He would visit the hospital whenever he could, but it wasn’t daily. Most of our conversations were positive, but always brief and abstract in their nature. I didn’t realize what a father meant until this point, and that realization confused me. Intellectually, I understood two sources of chromosomal contributions equals two parents, but having spent 90% of my life with no one other than my mother I never “got” it until then.
