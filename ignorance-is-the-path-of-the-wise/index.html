Worst even, I don’t think it would have mattered; I was dying, I didn’t care. It still shocks me to this day how little thought I really gave to the consequences of my actions. Regardless, down the rabbit hole I went; blind to the reality that surrounded me.</p><p>My first attempt to get off the ground was sound, but it failed because I fell for an unscrupulous supplier. A nephew and I got a loan for $10,000 USD from our fathers and found a wholesaler online. We did what due diligence we could, vetted her as much as we knew how, and then asked for our parents opinions. Getting the go ahead, we met with our first customer, a fellow cousin, that was about to start a new venture and needed compute infrastructure and systems in place.

When we realized we got scammed we immediately told our customer and promptly returned his check. Our parents chuckled, having both been the victims at some point in their lives of unscrupulous suppliers. My father, believing I was to bear the brunt of this defeat refunded my nephew’s father of his $5,000 USD and repeated what we had told him to ensure no hard feelings, but more important, in his mind, to save face. I was distraught.</p><p>Failure had come early, and fast! My father, nonplussed, told me if I wanted to do this I was going to have to accept it and move on. This was the first time I realized how little time I had spent with my father my whole life. He would visit the hospital whenever he could, but it wasn’t daily. Most of our conversations were positive, but always brief and abstract in their nature. I didn’t realize what a father meant until this point, and that realization confused me. Intellectually, I understood two sources of chromosomal contributions equals two parents, but having spent 90% of my life with no one other than my mother I never “got” it until then. That saddened me. I knew I didn’t have long to live and only just then had discovered a father.</p><p>Ignorance is the path of the wise, I suppose.
