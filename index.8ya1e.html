I could once more focus on the world around me, in the present, than lose myself in endless self-examination. I returned to Honduras to finish my senior year of high school, and I was ready to take it for all it was worth. Nothing seemed impossible, girls, crazy adventures, and the persistent need for an adrenaline rush. The world revealed itself for the game that it was, and I felt like I had the cheat codes. I was alive…</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="56"><p>I created multiple social circles and made sure there was no overlap between them. Honduran society, whether spoken or not, is largely based on economic casts. I had the freedom to move between them, not just because of my family’s status but because nobody knew who I was. Truth is the further I went down the line the better the people I encountered, not always but most of the time.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_GraphicalColumn2x-d216239b-4e37-4164-b1b2-a76bdbcaad26" class="Section Section--components-2 p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8 color-title title-size-small section-bgcover-wo  text-align-left  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="57"><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="58"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="59"><a class=" " href="the-shackles-of-my-humanity" data-reactid="60"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="61"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="62"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/077ed7a39abcd1c538275a3d49afca49/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Ffcba85d6051b7533d631cca32f4c0814a84d0469.jpg&amp;width=201" style="object-position:55.223880597014926% 21.333333333333336%;" data-reactid="63"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/077ed7a39abcd1c538275a3d49afca49/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Ffcba85d6051b7533d631cca32f4c0814a84d0469.jpg&amp;width=201" style="object-position:55.223880597014926% 21.333333333333336%;" data-reactid="64"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/077ed7a39abcd1c538275a3d49afca49/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Ffcba85d6051b7533d631cca32f4c0814a84d0469.jpg&amp;width=201" style="object-position:55.223880597014926% 21.333333333333336%;" data-reactid="65"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/077ed7a39abcd1c538275a3d49afca49/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Ffcba85d6051b7533d631cca32f4c0814a84d0469.jpg&amp;width=201" style="object-position:55.223880597014926% 21.333333333333336%;" data-reactid="66"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="201" data-height="300" data-ratio="0.67" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/077ed7a39abcd1c538275a3d49afca49/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Ffcba85d6051b7533d631cca32f4c0814a84d0469.jpg&amp;width=201" style="object-position:55.223880597014926% 21.333333333333336%;" data-reactid="67"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="68"><!-- react-empty: 69 --><!-- react-empty: 70 --><!-- react-empty: 71 --><!-- react-empty: 72 --><!-- react-empty: 73 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="74"><p>I am not a writer, though I write.

My few connections to the outside purposely limited and kept on a need to know basis. I didn’t know how to live on the outside. Like a decades long prisoner unsure how to deal with the chaos of reality; I missed my box. My condition would relapse approximately every two and a half years, it was a long distance relationship, as I rationalized it. When I was back in the hospital, despite the pain and side effects, it felt like home. The assurance that with every relapse my condition was getting worse felt so reassuring, nothing mattered because I would “shuffle of this mortal coil” briefly.</p></div></div></div><div class="Component j-c-center a-i-center p-1 color-title  color-box-pop-cycle" data-reactid="76"><div class="Group Group--graphical p-1" data-reactid="77"><a class=" " href="survival-is-the-life-of-somebody-worth-saving" data-reactid="78"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="79"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="80"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b8a361c828e90dccd1795c78b05393cd/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcddc8fda29b6d612ce2a0d1b47eb9cb6f29fc6a3.jpg&amp;width=386" style="object-position:47.020725388601036% 29.274611398963728%;" data-reactid="81"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b8a361c828e90dccd1795c78b05393cd/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcddc8fda29b6d612ce2a0d1b47eb9cb6f29fc6a3.jpg&amp;width=386" style="object-position:47.020725388601036% 29.274611398963728%;" data-reactid="82"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b8a361c828e90dccd1795c78b05393cd/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcddc8fda29b6d612ce2a0d1b47eb9cb6f29fc6a3.jpg&amp;width=386" style="object-position:47.020725388601036% 29.274611398963728%;" data-reactid="83"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f8014166db970852bb3e9a5f312e6c37/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcddc8fda29b6d612ce2a0d1b47eb9cb6f29fc6a3.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:47.020725388601036% 29.274611398963728%;" data-reactid="84"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="386" data-height="579" data-ratio="0.6666666666666666" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b8a361c828e90dccd1795c78b05393cd/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2Fcddc8fda29b6d612ce2a0d1b47eb9cb6f29fc6a3.jpg&amp;width=386" style="object-position:47.020725388601036% 29.274611398963728%;" data-reactid="85"/></picture></div></a></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 p-t-0" data-reactid="86"><!-- react-empty: 87 --><!-- react-empty: 88 --><!-- react-empty: 89 --><!-- react-empty: 90 --><!-- react-empty: 91 --><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="92"><p>Survival is the life of somebody worth saving; I wasn’t that life.

Rejection, or the fear of it really, is a powerful weapon that women lord over men. I figured, I was going to die anyway, what’s the worst they can do? Say, “no!” Hardly, anything to fear. I surmise that it stems from a fear of the unknown. Not knowing whether you’ll be rejected is a powerful motivator to stay away. Having five sisters gave me unprecedented access to opposition intelligence so I devised the direct approach. I would approach women as equals and express my direct intentions and my appreciation. I would say I had a 40% success rate on average. That may seem low at first blush, but I’m proud of that statistic.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_GraphicalMixSplit-018f754c-683b-48e8-95d2-bddf84178ee2" class="Section

First lesson, pain is truth; most have never experienced the kind of life changing pain I’m referring to which is why I think sometimes it’s hard for me to relate to other hominids. This type of pain changes your perception of reality; for myself, it seemed I could just make out the edges of the curtain on reality; as if peeling it back would reveal the wizard pulling the levers behind it. If reality was this tenuous projection upon a thin veil, that everyone around me seemed blind to, then I was going to make it my own; king be the one-eyed man in the land of the blind.</p></div><div class="Paragraph ms-t-a-j" data-reactid="161"><p>Second lesson, human consciousness is a feeble balancing act on the precipice of insanity. Every single human lives within a different reality created by interactions with the world, with that in mind communication with others seem futile and the source of most conflicts. Learning that at age 11 made for some interesting observations, i.e. most humans don’t listen, and due to lack of information from this ignored data input the brain makes its own conclusions and provides that as the relevant information. This was a rather enjoyable loophole to exploit and get my way with the hospital staff.

Without any sincere treatment options we returned to the Miami Children’s Hospital for long-term care; I focused on research. Two years of horrible medications that had worse side-effects than the condition itself; I hated those pills. Shortly thereafter I had learned as much as there was to learn about ITP, the result was grim, I was going to die. Due to the aggressive nature of my version of ITP death would be inevitable; but it would take a while, I found no known cases of this sort living past 30 years of age. Disputing the discrepancies between manual and automated cell counts due to platelet cell size and age with the oncologist while in between plasma transfusions gave me a reputation within those hospital walls, one I was proud of. Which pointed out a hard truth: I believe intelligence is an affectation I use both to feel better about myself and to feel superior to those around me; but at that point in my life it felt like it was all I had.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}}]},"b581345c-2851-4a00-895d-006c6a6f68c2":{"id":"b581345c-2851-4a00-895d-006c6a6f68c2","index":8,"created_by":"d31512e1-4f98-4172-8d5a-d49fc4b823a2","updated_by":"d31512e1-4f98-4172-8d5a-d49fc4b823a2","created_at":"2016-02-05T04:33:46.090Z","updated_at":"2016-02-08T05:32:43.193Z","published":true,"score":0,"path":"_posts/2016-02-05-live-or-die-on-this-day.md","_title":"Live or Die on this day… ","metadata":{"@type":"Article","url":"live-or-die-on-this-day/index.html","inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":true,"inNav":false,"_description":"I got eight months of normalcy, or at least as normal as I could get.","title":"Live or Die on this day… ","keywords":[]},"content":[{"id":"8a0b5ad1-560b-4031-bb7b-566edcfd52ca","item":"b581345c-2851-4a00-895d-006c6a6f68c2","type":"image","src":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9c04ce45-6bd9-4730-b790-0a0fafd5a985.jpg","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<picture>\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1440px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c143c43aea33f20476530516293dcfcf/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg&width=1024\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 1280px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c143c43aea33f20476530516293dcfcf/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg&width=1024\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 720px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ca0155df4e908969bfef8f4a34f5dd28/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg&width=720\">\n  <source media=\"(min-width: 360px)\" srcset=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b479072f57197c9bbcae95d7e840c38a/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg&width=360\">\n  <img src=\"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c143c43aea33f20476530516293dcfcf/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg&width=1024\">\n</picture>\n","metadata":{"starred":true},"cover":{"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c143c43aea33f20476530516293dcfcf/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg&width=1024","original":"https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9c04ce45-6bd9-4730-b790-0a0fafd5a985.jpg","imgflosrc":"https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg","ratio":"1024:717","aspect":1.4281729428172942,"orientation":"landscape","width":1024,"height":717,"rotation":0,"animated":false,"pictureImgfloUrls":[{"width":1440,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c143c43aea33f20476530516293dcfcf/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg&width=1024"},{"width":1280,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/c143c43aea33f20476530516293dcfcf/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg&width=1024"},{"width":720,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ca0155df4e908969bfef8f4a34f5dd28/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg&width=720"},{"width":360,"src":"https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/b479072f57197c9bbcae95d7e840c38a/insta_hefe.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F0269b4f2c97c656ae1815683dd47adf9d67c7a65.jpg&width=360"}],"colors":[[240,203,132],[216,157,67],[186,111,28],[164,85,16],[255,255,250]],"saliency":{"bounding_rect":[[126,41],[898,681]],"confidence":0.129337,"center":[512,369],"radius":408.539},"exif":{}}},{"id":"3ff9f80a-1fb2-4b63-8da3-b47c26c7af5c","item":"b581345c-2851-4a00-895d-006c6a6f68c2","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"I got eight months of normalcy, or at least as normal as I could get.
