<p>Growing up apart from society, confined within hospital walls, gave me an exception to what I consider its monopoly on conformity. I had to learn quickly and adapt. I spent my childhood learning this lesson. A lesson I thought I was done learning; and like most other times in life, upon self reflection, I realize how wrong I was.</p><p>I was eleven, just released from my gilded cage, looking for more answers to my curiosity. More data to feed my incessant questions. I was allowed to go back to school for the last week of fifth grade. It had been years since I had interacted with this many hominids my age. Standing at the entrance to the classroom I had flashbacks of National Geographic specials. I thought to myself, if Jack Hanna hadn’t made it to Honduras then I would continue his work.</p><p>I couldn’t stop staring. Their behavior fascinated me. It seemed like they were self-aware and yet in other ways, like most of the genus, nothing more than genetically predisposed bundles of nerves operating under electrochemical reactions to exterior stimuli. I wondered if they perhaps had learned some lesson I hadn’t and moved past this phase of questioning, or were they just as oblivious as the others I met in the hospital. A short conversation with my immediate neighbors quickly pointed to the latter. I couldn’t hide my disappointment.</p><p>The leader of the pack guided us outside as she explained the convoluted rules of some seemingly inane celebration called banana day. At least that answered why I was told that morning that I was not to wear the school uniform but “color clothes”, as they called them. I went with black jeans and a grey t-shirt as my indication of quiet rebellion; no one noticed. Being the last to walk outside of the classroom I noticed only one child behind the pack. Sitting on the guard rail, staring at the others, looking somewhat amused. I wondered, could this be? Could I have found another like me?</p><p>Recalling what I had read about hominid interactions, psychology, sociology, and earlier interactions an exploratory mission was quickly formed. I approached the subject carefully, to not attract the attention of the others. As my studies in psychology had taught me, people like what’s most like them, so I pointed out that we had the same brand and type of jeans. He stared at mine and looked at his; awkwardly twisting to check the label on his, only to confirm my observation. I quickly continued, “I’m Mario, what’s your name?”, “Francisco” he said. He asked why he had not seen me before. I explained that I had just returned to school because I was previously in the US, while being more self-conscious of the scars on my legs despite not being visible. Frantically formulating an escape plan, thinking that my mission had failed and I would be discovered. Francisco interrupted my thoughts, “I transferred from another school, so I don’t really know anyone, want to be partners?” My thoughts jumped from one conclusion to the next, until I realized he meant partners for the day’s activities that the teachers at the front of the pack were discussing. I nodded frantically, trying to hide my excitement for what seemed like a welcomed adventure.</p><p>On the field with my accomplice, the kids stood in a circle as the teacher explained that the first event was a clue hunt. We had to find the banana shaped cardboard with a clue on it, which would lead us to the next clue. The first team to find the last clue and solve the puzzle wins. What Francisco didn’t know was that I couldn’t run very fast, or at all really; since the last surgery it had only been weeks since I had learned to walk again. I scrambled to come up with a plan. So we huddle in and I explain to Francisco that I will stand in the middle of the field while he runs to the clues and back so that I can solve them. Unaware of the major flaw in my plan, he agrees and runs off. However, a curious thing happens, I see him run to the first clue then run off to another part of the field, then another, shortly after the entire class is chasing him, as he runs from one section to the next. About five minutes in he stops and looks around a little confused then runs back to me, standing befuddled in the middle of the field. That’s when I realize the hilarity of what ensued. Francisco saw most of the clues, so he ran to the first took it, ran to the second took that one, and continued taking each clue until he couldn’t see any more of them, then he ran back to me. Suffice to say the others were not happy and the teacher was neither. Banana day was cancelled, she proclaimed, I could feel the stares and anger from the others. We were escorted to the cafeteria and proceeded to have lunch. Francisco and I sat together away from the others. “Call me Frank” he said. This was not meant to be a full day of school, so after lunch we were dismissed. “I have a pool, want to join me at my house, it’s just across the street?” I said. “Okay…” he replied. We spent the rest of the day in the pool talking about his adventures at another school and why he had transferred.</p><p>I didn’t realize it that day, but that was the beginning of a friendship that still holds to this day. What I did realize is that human consciousness is a tenuous balancing act on the precipice of insanity, and most of us are just fighting the good fight, in our own little way. That pleases me to no end. Perhaps, I thought, despite the pain and suffering I had survived I might just get some joy out of this.</p><p>“Great men are forged in fire.
