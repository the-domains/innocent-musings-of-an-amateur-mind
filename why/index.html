<p>How the fuck did I get into this mess!?! Despite knowing the answer, I kept asking myself as I stared aimlessly at the door in my unlit room. I was alone again, in the literal sense as I always feel alone anyway. Burned my way through another social circle out of sheer boredom, and in the process alienated someone I should have cared about but those emotions never seemed to align within me. </p><p>I felt so depressed. Not because I had, once more, cut my self off from the world but because my experiment had failed. For some indeterminable reason, at least at the time, I had run into a string of failed social experiments. I was on a “cold streak”.</p><p>I didn’t leave my room for two weeks. I had to reset, and that little corner of reality felt safe to me. Alone with my thoughts I was, in a sense, happy. The problem lied in reintegration. An event I have dealt with repeatedly throughout my life, this time seemed more difficult. I was unsure why that was, so I decided to focus on that; hence the two weeks. This was the first time I’d struggled with this process, before I just saw it as a phoenix rising from its ashes to burn once more. </p><p>I took a long shower and practiced emotional reactions and responses in the mirror to make sure they would be in line with social expectations; I took special notice of my eyes. “The eyes are the windows to the soul/mind” is a refrain most people are familiar with and yet so few actually practice consciously. I didn’t feel ready to leave my corner of reality, but knew I had to, so off I went into the sunlight.</p><p>The question did linger, “why?”. Why was this time harder than the others? Could it be that this is not a sustainable social model? It was the first time I had doubts about the foundations of my methods. So I wondered…</p><p>As I approached the campus an unexpected interaction presented itself. “Beautiful day”, I said, “Yeah! Gorgeous! I love how puffy the clouds look.”, she said. I smiled, while questioning the purpose of mankind if this before me was, to me, its ambassador. Equally struggling not to frown at the depressing realization from the books in her arms that this human was in training to be a climatologist. “We are definitely going to die…” I thought. “I’m Mario, what’s your name?”, I said. “Hi Mario! I’m Lauren”, she said. “I’m going to lunch, Lauren, and would appreciate your company as you teach me about the climate and how humans are going to destroy it.”, I said, half joking and in a somewhat sarcastic tone, subconsciously hoping that she understood I was including her in that criticism. “Oh, okay! I’d love to! By the way, where are you from? I love your accent!” she said. “Honduras”, I said in the most emphatic Spanish accent possible, while smiling sardonically.</p><p>We walked to lunch as we continued our conversation, and I smiled as I realized that despite my initial struggle I was back.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="19"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="20"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="21"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="22"><span data-reactid="23"><!-- react-empty: 24 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="25"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="26">Why?</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="27"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="29"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
