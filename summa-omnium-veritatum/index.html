First lesson, pain is truth; most have never experienced the kind of life changing pain I’m referring to which is why I think sometimes it’s hard for me to relate to other hominids. This type of pain changes your perception of reality; for myself, it seemed I could just make out the edges of the curtain on reality; as if peeling it back would reveal the wizard pulling the levers behind it. If reality was this tenuous projection upon a thin veil, that everyone around me seemed blind to, then I was going to make it my own; king be the one-eyed man in the land of the blind.</p><p>Second lesson, human consciousness is a feeble balancing act on the precipice of insanity. Every single human lives within a different reality created by interactions with the world, with that in mind communication with others seem futile and the source of most conflicts. Learning that at age 11 made for some interesting observations, i.e. most humans don’t listen, and due to lack of information from this ignored data input the brain makes its own conclusions and provides that as the relevant information. This was a rather enjoyable loophole to exploit and get my way with the hospital staff. Weight gain due to overexposure to sugar was inevitable.</p><p>Third lesson, and this one took another decade to learn, people like me don’t just happen. I know I’m not normal, but that’s mostly the leftovers of a life marked by more pain than I care to admit or remember. I’ve done my best to suffer in my little corner of reality; because, as I saw it, that was in the end my only way to avoid dealing with the other hairless monkeys. If I hid my pain, I thought, they would leave me alone; and they did. I was alone to wallow in the only companion I had since I was six…pain.</p><p>Fourth lesson, happiness is the result of brushes with pain. Due to the lack of a diagnosis I was kept in the “clean rooms” in the pediatric cancer ward. Not only was I in pain, but it surrounded me, death became the most real thing my version of reality provided. The irony was that those of us whom suffered the most laughed the most. Nothing seemed sacrosanct enough not to laugh at, not even the looming Pyrrhic victory over pain; death.
