When I’ve told my stories to a select few I get the impression that they thought I was this strong-willed kid that survived horrible things, almost heroically. I disagree, the truth is, I didn’t have a choice; which is why I struggled with my past for so long. The first 15 years of my life were a blur of pain and medications with a sprinkling of laughter and tears. I quietly understood that I was going to die, but that seemed like such an abstract idea at the time. Besides, which 13-year-old kid doesn’t think 30 years is super old. I think what shaped how I look at the world the most was the realization that the future is a noose on the necks of the unenlightened masses.</p><p>I was going to die, the future had no hold on me other than an unquestionable end. Knowing that, I felt free; free to focus on the present, free to suffer and laugh without remorse, free to live without time for regrets. I now realize how much of a gift that was. I was not heroic or brave, in any way, but I was free to live my life the way most people dream to.</p><p>I was remorseless in my unwavering pursuit to satisfy any and all curiosities. The problem with a scorched earth policy, as the one I embraced, is that at some point you may be forced to look back, assess the damage and face your victims. The possibility, though it crossed my mind, was ignored being that my certain demise would impeach me of my resolve and simultaneously assuage the plaintiffs.</p><p>On my merry way I went in my blatant disregard for social conventions and decency. Though fleeting and unsustainable, at some point everyone should feel the satisfaction of being this selfish. The problem with people who take this path, history has taught us, is that there are only two possible outcomes: you either die trying or take over the world. I wasn’t planning on the latter and reveled in the satisfaction of the former.</p><p>In the end, I realized the unfortunate truth that fear is the driving force of mankind. Fear makes us notice the differences, fear stops us from trying, fear makes us kill each other, fear can kill us. Life, people don’t seem to realize, is a fleeting spark of electricity that breathes consciousness into innocuous bags of chemicals. What’s the fucking point of holding on to time as it slips through our fingers and is unrelenting in its push towards our demise. A fellow hominid once asked me how I could just stop being afraid of consequences; my answer, life requires three things: Purpose; do what makes you happy. Love; do who makes you happy. Money; you can’t really sustain the other two without money. Nothing else really matters and are thinly veiled attempts by our fears to hide.</p><p>Acquiring these three, not necessarily in that order, however usually acquired in that order, makes for what I would call a good life. This is my meager attempt at advice: fuck being afraid, we’re all going to die anyway.
