            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An Amateur Mind</h1><p>My life has been a continually rolling series of failures, fuck ups, and hospital beds. This definitely isn’t an instruction guide for happiness nor success, rather a somewhat shitty recounting of how I survived some of it and fucked up the rest.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b95380553fbc7e21f2fc938d5e72a9e99c7eecff.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The waves of loneliness crash upon the hardened levees of my solitude… </h1><p>No matter the people or my surroundings I’ve always felt alone. Human relationships feel so temporary to me. It could be a self-fulfilling bias. I presume relationships are temporary therefore make them temporary. Equally, I don’t get attached because I don’t feel connected and I don’t feel connected because I don’t get attached. In the end, the result is the same; solitude.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/372697efc13ba7802e0df15b89a45ca4b00396e1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It’s not easy being green… </h1><p>Growing up I always felt different. It was obvious to me that I didn’t fit in, despite my endless attempts to pretend to. Impostor syndrome, they call it, or so I read. Not sure if that’s because of my time spent away for normal social interactions with the humans or I’m just the result of an electrochemical physiological imbalance due to abhorrent genetic expressions. Truth is I’ve felt this way every day of my life.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/82fb952731730a6ebdd2bfb20fa791c0e1ed463c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The right spark… ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The right spark… </h1><p>My insecurities, my impending death, the world and everyone in it washed away from my mind as I focused on my creation. Nothing else mattered. I left college that summer a curious boy and returned a changed man, still immature and reclusive but different none the less. I could not concentrate on anything else. I tried to ignore the siren’s call and tie my attention to the mast of my mind’s ship; like Odysseus I failed. College was no longer the place for me.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/212bba3c9cbf48c0de76d25e36a409d895de0bb9.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[The power of silence… ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The power of silence… </h1><p>…then in one night of insomnia and scrambled thoughts, I was annoyed by all the lights in my bedroom. The years of inane hoarding of portals to my technological proclivities had finally come back to assault my senses. Awash in blinking status lights I arose groggy and irritated in a desperate pursuit of the greatest nerd tool of all, electrical tape. I attacked the photonic emitters mercilessly and with efficiency rarely seen outside elite military units. With the mission accomplished, darkness embraced me and my weary mind. A sardonic smirk across my face I lay down in a meager attempt at unconsciousness.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cb9e04b82ed00223c759b7b029527249c439d21b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The hardened levees of my solitude… </h1><p>Leaving Honduras once more I could feel my whole body relax. My breaths felt deeper and more satisfying, my posture a little straighter, my attitude slightly relaxed. I barely spent a little over one year before graduating and leaving for college. On the flight to Miami I wasn’t sure what to think of my decision not just of attending Florida Tech in a small town such as Melbourne, but of accepting to major in Civil Engineering. It was a difficult decision, one I struggled with, and to this day consider a mistake.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7c50473f0645d6949b02c54d48e6e51621cc52a4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I’m not afraid to fall… </h1><p>I’m frustrated and sad. I question whether I am even capable of achieving the goals of my ambitions. I want to make a mark in history but can I? How do I regain a confidence I wasn’t even sure I had, and now long for? Logic and reason is how. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b6722545bdbd2d6879654ad0e206bbed755605fc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An interesting posit of a fantasy for when my reality was unbearable… </h1><p>I’m wrong. I’m not the victim of a genetic short stick from a universe hell-bent on my destruction. My mind bears the scars of constant threats to its sanity and my survival. These scars are not liabilities that should be carefully navigated around and treated as brain damage. These scars are my armor, my shield, the infrastructure that holds dearly the potential of my great future. I survived, but I want more than to be a survivor, that is too common a goal for the pain I suffered and my ambitions. The scars of my survival are the foundation for greatness. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/55ad2c8e5c449d4cb1b296f2b6bdeb68a37bf4c1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
