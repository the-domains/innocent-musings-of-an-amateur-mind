            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An Amateur Mind</h1><p>My life has been a continually rolling series of failures, fuck ups, and hospital beds. This definitely isn’t an instruction guide for happiness nor success, rather a somewhat shitty recounting of how I survived some of it and fucked up the rest.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b95380553fbc7e21f2fc938d5e72a9e99c7eecff.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>They drew first blood… </h1><p>Endless hospital halls and the pervasive smell of sanitizer were staples of the memories of my childhood. I could not shake the feeling that I had missed some essential part of life, or maybe I just didn’t want to believe that this was all life was. I returned to Honduras changed; pain had forced me to grow up faster than even I wanted to, despite its advantages in dealing with my situation. </p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/9b83abfc-e0b9-4ec5-a688-4af46b2e7c89.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Summa Omnium Veritatum… ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Summa Omnium Veritatum… </h1><p>It was early on in my life that I learned lessons that, now I realize, take most humans a lifetime to learn; if ever. First lesson, pain is truth; most have never experienced the kind of life changing pain I’m referring to which is why I think sometimes it’s hard for me to relate to other hominids. This type of pain changes your perception of reality; for myself, it seemed I could just make out the edges of the curtain on reality; as if peeling it back would reveal the wizard pulling the levers behind it. If reality was this tenuous projection upon a thin veil, that everyone around me seemed blind to, then I was going to make it my own; king be the one-eyed man in the land of the blind.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0d536cc84bc3cc1370005f0bc6f284f702efa9d6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame… </h1><p>Growing up apart from society, confined within hospital walls, gave me an exception to what I consider its monopoly on conformity. I had to learn quickly and adapt. I spent my childhood learning this lesson. A lesson I thought I was done learning; and like most other times in life, upon self reflection, I realize how wrong I was.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8c6933a32056359e3ceb0c1e7fdeedd979689fb3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The right spark… </h1><p>My insecurities, my impending death, the world and everyone in it washed away from my mind as I focused on my creation. Nothing else mattered. I left college that summer a curious boy and returned a changed man, still immature and reclusive but different none the less. I could not concentrate on anything else. I tried to ignore the siren’s call and tie my attention to the mast of my mind’s ship; like Odysseus I failed. College was no longer the place for me.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It’s not easy being green… </h1><p>Growing up I always felt different. It was obvious to me that I didn’t fit in, despite my endless attempts to pretend to. Impostor syndrome, they call it, or so I read. Not sure if that’s because of my time spent away for normal social interactions with the humans or I’m just the result of an electrochemical physiological imbalance due to abhorrent genetic expressions. Truth is I’ve felt this way every day of my life.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The corners of my mind… </h1><p>Playing with computers and solving problems I get little whispers of happiness but they’re always fleeting. I feel like a junkie running from one situation to the other trying to get my fix. It’s the silence in between fixes that always gets me; the ramblings from the corners of my mind.</p></article>]]></description>
