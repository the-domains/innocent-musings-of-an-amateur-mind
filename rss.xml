            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An Amateur Mind</h1><p>My life has been a continually rolling series of failures, fuck ups, and hospital beds. This definitely isn’t an instruction guide for happiness nor success, rather a somewhat shitty recounting of how I survived some of it and fucked up the rest.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/b95380553fbc7e21f2fc938d5e72a9e99c7eecff.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Dr. Frankenstein’s monster… ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Dr. Frankenstein’s monster… </h1><p>Two weeks after returning from the military academy something in me came to life. I could once more focus on the world around me, in the present, than lose myself in endless self-examination. I returned to Honduras to finish my senior year of high school, and I was ready to take it for all it was worth. Nothing seemed impossible, girls, crazy adventures, and the persistent need for an adrenaline rush. The world revealed itself for the game that it was, and I felt like I had the cheat codes. I was alive…</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a9cdeb3c-f43e-4a2c-b231-dcdadcde341b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The shackles of my humanity… </h1><p>I am not a writer, though I write. I am not a philosopher, though I think. I am not a scientist, though I wonder. I love, I saunter, I reminisce. I do all these things and many more, though I am only defined by the boundaries set by my fears. My impending death cast thy fears asunder, abstaining my definition, releasing me of the shackles of my humanity.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fcba85d6051b7533d631cca32f4c0814a84d0469.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Survival is the life of somebody worth saving… </h1><p>Survival is the life of somebody worth saving; I wasn’t that life. I didn’t want to survive, I ravaged, pillaged, and burned my way through. Life, to me, was a burning ember comprised of a genetic dead-end. I intended to blow on the ember making it burn as hot and as bright as it could. Burn, baby, burn…</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/cddc8fda29b6d612ce2a0d1b47eb9cb6f29fc6a3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war… </h1><p>Growing up is hard for most, but the challenges I faced forced me to do most of it. When I’ve told my stories to a select few I get the impression that they thought I was this strong-willed kid that survived horrible things, almost heroically. I disagree, the truth is, I didn’t have a choice; which is why I struggled with my past for so long. The first 15 years of my life were a blur of pain and medications with a sprinkling of laughter and tears. I quietly understood that I was going to die, but that seemed like such an abstract idea at the time. Besides, which 13-year-old kid doesn’t think 30 years is super old. I think what shaped how I look at the world the most was the realization that the future is a noose on the necks of the unenlightened masses.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8077c0d9a6ba3a7435adc40a367e4268e43930a4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>They drew first blood… </h1><p>Endless hospital halls and the pervasive smell of sanitizer were staples of the memories of my childhood. I could not shake the feeling that I had missed some essential part of life, or maybe I just didn’t want to believe that this was all life was. I returned to Honduras changed; pain had forced me to grow up faster than even I wanted to, despite its advantages in dealing with my situation. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ce4e45d7b2ea542fad8aff08fd954579496b2ecd.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Summa Omnium Veritatum… ]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Summa Omnium Veritatum… </h1><p>It was early on in my life that I learned lessons that, now I realize, take most humans a lifetime to learn; if ever. First lesson, pain is truth; most have never experienced the kind of life changing pain I’m referring to which is why I think sometimes it’s hard for me to relate to other hominids. This type of pain changes your perception of reality; for myself, it seemed I could just make out the edges of the curtain on reality; as if peeling it back would reveal the wizard pulling the levers behind it. If reality was this tenuous projection upon a thin veil, that everyone around me seemed blind to, then I was going to make it my own; king be the one-eyed man in the land of the blind.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/0d536cc84bc3cc1370005f0bc6f284f702efa9d6.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>It is the privilege of lesser men to light the flame… </h1><p>Growing up apart from society, confined within hospital walls, gave me an exception to what I consider its monopoly on conformity. I had to learn quickly and adapt. I spent my childhood learning this lesson. A lesson I thought I was done learning; and like most other times in life, upon self reflection, I realize how wrong I was.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8c6933a32056359e3ceb0c1e7fdeedd979689fb3.jpg"></article>]]></description>
