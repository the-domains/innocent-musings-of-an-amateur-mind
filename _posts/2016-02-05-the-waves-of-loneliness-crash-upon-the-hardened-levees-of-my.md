No matter the people or my surroundings I've always felt alone. Human relationships feel so temporary to me. It could be a self-fulfilling bias. I presume relationships are temporary therefore make them temporary. Equally, I don't get attached because I don't feel connected and I don't feel connected because I don't get attached. In the end, the result is the same; solitude.

I know this has changed my perception and bias of those around me. More so, this perception has hurt those that cared for me the most. In a way this was soothing. I felt free of baggage or loose ends, at least that's what I told myself. I realized I was missing out on a lot of the human experience because of this, but I rationalized it to be my only logical choice in light of my impending demise.

I think the real regret and concern is that I do not regret any of it.

Am I a sociopath? This is something I've asked myself repeatedly. I usually dismiss the interrogation with the declarative, and more than likely false, statement crazy people don't know they are crazy. The fact that I'm asking myself the question is in itself a proof of its improbability. Yet, the question remains. Lingering like the pervasive aroma of a wretched incense permeating my thoughts and dreams.

In the end, I lie alone in bed accepting of the fact that my loneliness is a demon of my own creation and simultaneously an angel for my own protection.
