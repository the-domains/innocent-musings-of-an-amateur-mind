First I was afraid of the needles, but my skin grew callused and scarred. Then I was afraid of the results, but my mind isolated emotion and empathy. Then I realized my enemy wasn't pain, emotion, or the humans; it was me. I have the choice to keep going or to give up and that is incredibly empowering. Do or die, fail or win...every day is a choice.

The amorality of nature is unquestionable in my mind and I am nothing more than a genetic permutation that survives exclusively on the shoulders of modern medicine. My war with the unfortunate results of a genetic lottery was a war with myself. Understanding, accepting, and moving on is the only decision I could take; not without some hesitation. 

"I had to live on", I thought to myself, "I have to see one more sunrise..."

Then, that inescapable question that has haunted me, from the spark of reason, crept to the forefront of my conscious thought, "How; why?"

Why do I want to remain? Why take the pain and suffering? Why continue? The why, was the hardest part. I'm still not completely sure that I have the right answer. The best I've conjured is that I must remain because the only real way this genetic anomaly can survive is by becoming immortal. Immortality? Lofty goal for a genetic dead-end on a tiny rock in an insignificant corner of the vast universe. 

I realize many have been on this quest and failed, the difference is I don't mean it literally. I truly believe that this amazing evolutionary creation that we call consciousness leads to one inevitable conclusion. The only reason to live is with the purpose to add meaning and value to the rest of the species. That way, some day way in the future, they can say humanity survived and I was a small but important part of the reason. That is immortality, and that is my goal. To live forever...in the memories and textbooks of mankind.

Right there, in my answer to why, is my answer to how. I need to make a difference, I need to add what little value I can to the species. Right now I'll do it by creating energy-efficient computing. Later on, we'll see. 

I have to live on, I have to see one more sunrise. To reach the end, I only have to succeed today...
