Sitting in a small room at 10AM with strangers I realize the fear in every beat of my heart. I feel like I'm about to fall off a cliff, and keep wondering if perhaps accepting death would just be easier than the constant struggles that have defined my life.

The lab technician calls me name. I sit as the freshly trained phlebologist noticeably shudders at my request for using my right arm, as opposed to her practice. I can almost hear her reciting the steps in her mind before speaking them out loud. She draws my blood, unbeknownst of the ramifications in that sample. I barely feel the needle, the scar from hundreds of these tests has numbed any sensitivity on my skin.

Proud of her success, I thank her, smile back, and walk away. I'll get my results tomorrow. One more day...I get one more day.
