I got eight months of normalcy, or at least as normal as I could get. In those eight months my friendship with Francisco blossomed into what it is today, a brotherly bond. Then it started...

I would fall asleep on a Tuesday and wake up Wednesday. Constantly feeling tired, almost narcoleptic. My mother being the consummate worrier decided this time not to rely on Honduran doctors, so we flew out to the Miami Children's Hospital. Test after test, each one requiring even more of my blood, it seemed. There is one I will never forget...

The doctor was still baffled by my mysterious condition and decided a bone marrow test was in order. The problem, I was a high risk patient with a compromised immune system, anesthesia would be risky. The decision was made, without my input, to forego anesthesia and do a bone marrow test in cold blood. Up to that day, pain was a relative term in my life. Despite having felt a lot of it I can sincerely say, this was the first time I was traumatized by it. It took six nurses to hold me down, as the doctor decided to take marrow from my hips. My mother kneeled crying in front of me on the table I lay, holding my hands. That's when I felt it first, the cold steel cutting through my flesh, a familiar pain. I could feel the metal hit the bone, when the drilling sound started. The doctor cut through flesh and bone to the marrow and started drawing the needle to collect his prize. The pain was almost unbearable, I sensed my subconscious desperately trying to escape; my thoughts disjointed and scattered memories flashing before me, as if to find the right movie to help this situation, though nothing did. My vision tunneled; parts of my body felt cold while others on fire, until I saw my mother, kneeled before me, crying. My mind saw an out, the question that had so haunted me before almost leapt out of my mind, why/how? Why was my mother crying, when this pain was mine? Could sympathy cause pain equal to the one being thrust upon me? If this was so, than sympathy did not appear to be a productive evolutionary trait.

I focused on her tears, streaming from her most human eyes. Why do the eyes leak when nerve endings are pushed to the limits of their stimulation? What are tears composed of? Sodium, must play a part, due to their savory taste. Leaks, humans leak all the time; the thought streaked through my mind, I could not help but giggle. I quickly surveyed the room, no one saw my slight moment of internal humor. I lost my focus at the worst possible time. The doctor had finished with the right hip and was about to start on the left. The spine tingling pain streaked across my body. I shivered uncontrollably, and the nurses leaned more of their weight as they struggled to stop my movement. I could feel the doctor drilling into my bone again, the weight of the nurses seemed to increase the pain. My vision tunneled again as my thoughts raced. I realized this was just a cycle, cause and effect. The pain triggered my fight or flight instincts. I could not do either physically so my mind attempted to flee.

I stared at my mother again. Leaks...a smirk quickly flashed across my face. She caught it and looked befuddled as the doctor finished his campaign. The doctor chuckled saying, "...that wasn't so bad..." as he spanked me just beneath the first incision. Pain flashed through my body, I almost jumped to attention, as the feelings of hatred and murderous revenge flooded my mind. My mother hugged me and the vendetta was over. That was the first time I understood, I could control some of my emotions to suit my needs, but I could also use them to influence others.

Lying in the hospital bed, still sore from my battle, I realized emotions are vestigial artifacts of our hominid ancestors, that is until you add information and intent, then they become useful weapons with which to navigate our environment. Hence, the term so widely misused by contemporary hominids, emotional intelligence.
