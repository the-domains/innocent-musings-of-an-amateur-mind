I was born on August 1983 in Tegucigalpa, Honduras...

Who cares!?! This isn't that kind of blog...

Fast forward six years, I was an unimpressive sickly looking kid with five sisters; relatively uncoordinated and yet unremittingly curious with everything around me.

Why/How?

The question lurked within me, unrelenting. Unabashed I let my curiosity loose on that and those around me. Most of the time resulting in scarring, pain, or scorns from others. Regardless, the result was always the same in my mind, more information, more data from which to analyze and understand the world around me.

I spent the majority of my childhood in hospitals and the rest of it recovering from those hospitals. It started when I was six and in a foolish prank gone wrong I broke my femur, only to discover this happened because the bone was but a shell, weakened by a tumor. Surgeries, months in strange contraptions to align the bone, casts, and incessant exposure to condescending doctors quickly taught me, by age eight, that the answer to the question "Is there intelligent life on this planet?" was inconclusive at best and that my limited interactions with the sentient beings were sufficient so that I could focus my curiosity on more noble pursuits.

Nothing seemed to satisfy my questions. How did the TV work? Why was that device beeping? What was behind the lights on that device? My curiosity knew no bounds. I struggled to understand how those around me did not seem tortured by the same questions. They appeared almost willfully ignorant of the wonder, while I seemed barely suited to contain it within me.

Why/How?
