My insecurities, my impending death, the world and everyone in it washed away from my mind as I focused on my creation. Nothing else mattered. I left college that summer a curious boy and returned a changed man, still immature and reclusive but different none the less. I could not concentrate on anything else. I tried to ignore the siren's call and tie my attention to the mast of my mind's ship; like Odysseus I failed. College was no longer the place for me.

My parents were dismayed at my assertion that I had to focus on my creation and depart from a structured education. Philosophical and intellectual battles ensued, until the consensus was reached. I would enroll in the local university and continue my studies while attempting to develop my crazy idea. I believed then as I do now that they knew I would never hold up to that, but decided to ignore that in an effort to appease me. Despite some early missteps, once the gate opened I was off to the races.

Honduras is definitely not the market or environment for tech startups, but it was my launch point to the rest of the world. I scoured the internet, travelled around the world and focused my attention on manufacturing. I found a small shop in the outskirts of Stuttgart, Germany. They stared at me with blank catatonic faces until I showed them how it would work. Curious but unlikely they said, thermal stability would not be achieved, catastrophic thermal failure was inevitable. I pushed them on the matter, yet they stood firm.

However, I had one advantage, money! That singular abstract concept that makes the modern world go round, was my ace. Sure enough, those Germans if nothing else were pragmatists. As far as they were concerned I would waste money for them to show me how it would not work, and I would then leave them alone. Luckily, my mathematical musings and my calculations were dead on. The prototype system quickly reached thermal stability and worked perfectly. 

With the makings of a product and a vision I returned to Honduras triumphant, ready for the next battle in my campaign. It seemed I had found the right spark...
