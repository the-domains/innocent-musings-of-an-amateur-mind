Two weeks after returning from the military academy something in me came to life. I could once more focus on the world around me, in the present, than lose myself in endless self-examination. I returned to Honduras to finish my senior year of high school, and I was ready to take it for all it was worth. Nothing seemed impossible, girls, crazy adventures, and the persistent need for an adrenaline rush. The world revealed itself for the game that it was, and I felt like I had the cheat codes. I was alive...

I created multiple social circles and made sure there was no overlap between them. Honduran society, whether spoken or not, is largely based on economic casts. I had the freedom to move between them, not just because of my family's status but because nobody knew who I was. Truth is the further I went down the line the better the people I encountered, not always but most of the time.

Some nights are still a blur, others are the almost unbelievable stories I recall to entertain myself. I'm still surprised that I was able to live almost completely separate lives. Senior year flew by, and by the time I was headed to college my intentions had changed once more. I started thinking of what I would leave behind. I had considered the damage, emotional and physical, I had caused, but I didn't want that to be the way I would be remembered. I struggled to clearly understand why I was even thinking about others, especially those that scarcely affected my day-to-day.

The optimism of a legacy was short lived. My darkness flooded me with nihilist thoughts, and the lack of purpose made it seem futile. Emotional setbacks led to introspection and before I realized what was happening I was consumed in darkness. Nothing seemed worthwhile, but there was a glimmer. Buried deep in my subconscious, lived a small long-forgotten thought: I can make a difference. It took years to understand that thought and figure out how I wanted to make a difference, but in my vast ocean of darkness there was a light; and for now, that was enough.
