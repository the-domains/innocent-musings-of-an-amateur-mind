Leaving Honduras once more I could feel my whole body relax. My breaths felt deeper and more satisfying, my posture a little straighter, my attitude slightly relaxed. I barely spent a little over one year before graduating and leaving for college. On the flight to Miami I wasn't sure what to think of my decision not just of attending Florida Tech in a small town such as Melbourne, but of accepting to major in Civil Engineering. It was a difficult decision, one I struggled with, and to this day consider a mistake.

Perhaps it was the apparent isolation of such a town that subconsciously lured me, I'm not sure. Regardless, I was unable to convince my parents to let me go alone. It felt like they were attempting to atone for letting go to Culver alone, which I was actually grateful for. We drove from Miami to Melbourne and seeing all the aerospace manufactures and engineering shops made me hopeful that this decision may have the potential I needed it to.

A quick tour, some generic platitudes delivered through a forced smile and the parental units were on their way. I stared at my surroundings and the thought of losing my solitude and privacy to the "human" I was assigned as a roommate provoked a sudden flash of cold and shiver through my body. I always felt conspicuous in the outside world, afraid that I may be discovered as an impostor, an un-human; and having to put up my defenses non-stop, day and night, felt exhausting before it even started. I tried, I really did try to fit in with the others, but I'm afraid my attempts were unsuccessful. I guess I missed the "assembly required" tag when it came to interactions with my fellow hairless monkeys.

I burned a lot of bridges, literally and figuratively, at least Civil Engineering had its fun parts, and the heavy focus on math and physics was nice. I spent most of my time roaming the library and stalking the labs in the Physics department looking for a little fun. Then one day I decided to eat lunch with the fellow Spanish speakers in the campus café. They invite me to a party that night, flashes of double-crosses and ambushes crossed my mind, but I needed the distraction. I desperately needed the distraction, saying there were few members of the opposite sex at FIT is like saying there's oxygen in low Earth orbit; yes perhaps a few molecules are banging about but not enough to take a breath.

I arrived a little late in the hopes of not being seen entering and displaying my awkward approach to analog audiovisual interactions. Not recognizing the vast majority of people I embarked upon one of my few pleasures and treated the party as an observation deck. Floating from one exhibit to the next I was quickly amused by the lack of diversity and variation in humans and their topics of interaction; all under the resounding drum of the one instinct that drives the majority of male thought and impetus, reproduce!

Delighted in my thoughts a voice cut straight through my inner monologue and interrupted: "FAC!....FAC!...Holy shit! FACUSSE, is that you?" I turn around only to see the awkward almost forced smile of my favorite export of the German people, Fred! My friend, confidant, and fellow Culver-ite. Up to that point I'm not sure either of us had hugged someone with such intent. Finally, it seemed I had discovered an oasis of civilization in my excursion through the wilderness. That day my view on college improved, and slowly the female condition did so as well; once we discovered the community college on the other side of town. It seemed, I would be okay.

I should have known better. The few moments of quiet in my life are but the deception of tranquility through the eye of the storm. Fred hated it probably more than I did and left for the greener pastures of USF in Tampa. I was unceremoniously left to my own devices, only to fall into a deep well of sadness and depression the likes of which I had never experienced. It was like in that one moment every struggle, every health issue, every argument, every embarrassment, and all the darkness within me simultaneously poured into my conscious thoughts and I was ill prepared to handle it.

It was a vicious circle of self cannibalization that ate away at me from the inside out. I retreated into my little corner of solitude and struggled to reason my way through the darkest corners of my mind. It felt like nothing and no one could stop this, and I started to believe it. I could almost hear the strain of the bones on my chest with the weight of my darkness. My muscles tensed, my thoughts fogged and incomprehensible, as I decided to end it.

I failed, but I kept trying. In the end I slowly started to feel comfortable in the darkness and accepted it. This didn't solve the problem but gave me some respite for my weary mind. I struggled with this depression, but realized that as the waves of loneliness crash upon the hardened levees of my solitude it was once more up to me to survive...
