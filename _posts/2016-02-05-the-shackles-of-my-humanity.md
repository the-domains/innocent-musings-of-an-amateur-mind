I am not a writer, though I write. I am not a philosopher, though I think. I am not a scientist, though I wonder. I love, I saunter, I reminisce. I do all these things and many more, though I am only defined by the boundaries set by my fears. My impending death cast thy fears asunder, abstaining my definition, releasing me of the shackles of my humanity.

I cut myself off from the world. My few connections to the outside purposely limited and kept on a need to know basis. I didn't know how to live on the outside. Like a decades long prisoner unsure how to deal with the chaos of reality; I missed my box. My condition would relapse approximately every two and a half years, it was a long distance relationship, as I rationalized it. When I was back in the hospital, despite the pain and side effects, it felt like home. The assurance that with every relapse my condition was getting worse felt so reassuring, nothing mattered because I would "shuffle of this mortal coil" briefly.

I enjoyed my time, but that reverence of death cast a shadow of darkness within me. More than three years passed without a relapse, and I worried, more so I became inconsolable. My friend, my darkness had left me. I cried because of the emptiness, and trembled at the thought of impending life. If my darkness had abandoned me, then I would do it myself. I would determine my timely demise, but alas, my desperation was unwarranted and my friend returned to me. Like a warm embrace the result from the lab consoled my depression, I was filled once more with hope that this dark shadow would finish the job. I was whole; and onward to my lovely death, free from the shackles of my humanity.
