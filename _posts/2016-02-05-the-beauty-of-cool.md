Heat pipes!?!?!

Ah yes! The heat pipe, a curios invention of the past century that enabled technological revolutions unbeknownst to the mere mortals that envisioned them. I started to frantically scribble the thoughts flashing by, as the idea formed in my mind. I didn't realize I was holding my breath trying to sketch my next computer until my vision was noticeably tunneling. My reality had its own vignette filter, I giggled, until I saw what I had drawn and took a breath. 

A computer inside one large heat sink thermally connected to the hot components with heat pipes. Could this be done? I knew heat pipes could be used to stabilize temperatures and transfer heat, but had anyone tried to do this holistically for a computer? Weeks of research and I couldn't find anyone working on this or any company offering the like.

I scrambled to the hardware store. Copper tubing, aluminum heat sinks, distilled water, the ingredients to my recipe started to read more and more like a witches cookbook as I progressed down the aisles...does anyone know which aisle has the eye of newt?

I spent the summer cooped up in my room, a reclusive misanthrope obsessed with the annihilation of computer fans. Weeks into the frustration of trying to produce home-made heat pipes I realized my cheeks hurt; I could not stop smiling. I was aware of my enjoyment of puzzles, but this was another level. Up to that point I had no memory of being that happy. Failure was irrelevant, I had found purpose!

Just before I had to return to college from summer break I was done. At 3AM I powered it on and freaked out the rest of the house with my uncontrollable maniacal laughter. At that moment I understood what Marry Shelley tried to convey in the moment of awakening of Dr. Frankenstein's creation. It was alive! ALIVE!!!

Actually it just beeped after a successful POST. I leaned in closer to my creation as the monitor flickered to life. Did it work? Had I solved the puzzle that had plagued me all summer? I waited over an hour and rested my head gently over the chassis. NO NOISE! Die fans, die!

The AC fan kicked in and I had reached utopia; a winter wonderland with a silent computer. The beauty of silence, the power of cool!
