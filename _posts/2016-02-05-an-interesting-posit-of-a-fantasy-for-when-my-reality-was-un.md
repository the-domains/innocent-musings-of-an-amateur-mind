I'm wrong. I'm not the victim of a genetic short stick from a universe hell-bent on my destruction. My mind bears the scars of constant threats to its sanity and my survival. These scars are not liabilities that should be carefully navigated around and treated as brain damage. These scars are my armor, my shield, the infrastructure that holds dearly the potential of my great future. I survived, but I want more than to be a survivor, that is too common a goal for the pain I suffered and my ambitions. The scars of my survival are the foundation for greatness. 

It was a gift early on to spend so much time away from society, conforming to its somewhat inane and archaic rules. I spent time learning, absorbing what few truths there are; mix that with pain and suffering, and I believe that is the soul of a great man, a man than can change the world. I am that man...I can change the world.

The final goal Is immortality...and the only way to do that is to change the world.
