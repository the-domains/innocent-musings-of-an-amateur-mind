It was early on in my life that I learned lessons that, now I realize, take most humans a lifetime to learn; if ever. First lesson, pain is truth; most have never experienced the kind of life changing pain I'm referring to which is why I think sometimes it's hard for me to relate to other hominids. This type of pain changes your perception of reality; for myself, it seemed I could just make out the edges of the curtain on reality; as if peeling it back would reveal the wizard pulling the levers behind it. If reality was this tenuous projection upon a thin veil, that everyone around me seemed blind to, then I was going to make it my own; king be the one-eyed man in the land of the blind.

Second lesson, human consciousness is a feeble balancing act on the precipice of insanity. Every single human lives within a different reality created by interactions with the world, with that in mind communication with others seem futile and the source of most conflicts. Learning that at age 11 made for some interesting observations, i.e. most humans don't listen, and due to lack of information from this ignored data input the brain makes its own conclusions and provides that as the relevant information. This was a rather enjoyable loophole to exploit and get my way with the hospital staff. Weight gain due to overexposure to sugar was inevitable.

Third lesson, and this one took another decade to learn, people like me don't just happen. I know I'm not normal, but that's mostly the leftovers of a life marked by more pain than I care to admit or remember. I've done my best to suffer in my little corner of reality; because, as I saw it, that was in the end my only way to avoid dealing with the other hairless monkeys. If I hid my pain, I thought, they would leave me alone; and they did. I was alone to wallow in the only companion I had since I was six...pain.

Fourth lesson, happiness is the result of brushes with pain. Due to the lack of a diagnosis I was kept in the "clean rooms" in the pediatric cancer ward. Not only was I in pain, but it surrounded me, death became the most real thing my version of reality provided. The irony was that those of us whom suffered the most laughed the most. Nothing seemed sacrosanct enough not to laugh at, not even the looming Pyrrhic victory over pain; death. The best models evolution could provide of the human species were its most flawed.

We returned to Honduras with little to show for our travels. The doctors at the Miami Children's Hospital could not provide a conclusive diagnosis. In a last-ditch effort we met with a Honduran hematologist specialized in oncological disorders. Finally, we had an answer; Purpura. A few days later we flew to what claimed to be the most advanced research hospital in America, if not the world, The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, more tests ensued. The team that took my case confirmed my diagnosis, Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). What the World Health Organization has labeled an orphan disease was now my reality. Without any sincere treatment options we returned to the Miami Children's Hospital for long-term care; I focused on research. Two years of horrible medications that had worse side-effects than the condition itself; I hated those pills. Shortly thereafter I had learned as much as there was to learn about ITP, the result was grim, I was going to die. Due to the aggressive nature of my version of ITP death would be inevitable; but it would take a while, I found no known cases of this sort living past 30 years of age. Disputing the discrepancies between manual and automated cell counts due to platelet cell size and age with the oncologist while in between plasma transfusions gave me a reputation within those hospital walls, one I was proud of. Which pointed out a hard truth: I believe intelligence is an affectation I use both to feel better about myself and to feel superior to those around me; but at that point in my life it felt like it was all I had.
