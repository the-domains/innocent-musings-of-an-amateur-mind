Survival is the life of somebody worth saving; I wasn't that life. I didn't want to survive, I ravaged, pillaged, and burned my way through. Life, to me, was a burning ember comprised of a genetic dead-end. I intended to blow on the ember making it burn as hot and as bright as it could. Burn, baby, burn...

One of the first superpowers I realized this attitude provided me was the effectiveness with which I could conquer the opposite sex. Rejection, or the fear of it really, is a powerful weapon that women lord over men. I figured, I was going to die anyway, what's the worst they can do? Say, "no!" Hardly, anything to fear. I surmise that it stems from a fear of the unknown. Not knowing whether you'll be rejected is a powerful motivator to stay away. Having five sisters gave me unprecedented access to opposition intelligence so I devised the direct approach. I would approach women as equals and express my direct intentions and my appreciation. I would say I had a 40% success rate on average. That may seem low at first blush, but I'm proud of that statistic.

The problem was not my success rate, but the repetitive nature of the game. I quickly got bored, so I devised social experiments to test the boundaries of the social structure that surrounded me and mostly to entertain myself. Entertaining it was, and I was well aware of the creaking noises from the boundaries I was pushing on. So, after a few lost acquaintances and being ostracized from multiple groups. I decided to take a more scientific approach.

I broke down the experiment into three stages: acquisition, enchantment, and sustainability. Integrating acquisition into a strict scientific experiment was tricky, each variable was constantly mutating based on the context of almost every other variable. Enchantment was much simpler, the variables were greatly reduced and cause and effect could be linearly correlated. Sustainability was interesting in that it reintroduced variables from the acquisition phase, nonetheless, the reduced variables allowed its integration into a scientific methodology.

Not having access to twins, or the like, I focused the acquisition phase of the experiment by profiling six males and six females with at least 80% uniformity of the characteristics of their respective genus. Finding commonality amongst seemingly superficial features was a simplistic yet surprisingly effective and efficient methodology. I prepared five different approaches based on popular cultural myths surrounding male to female first encounter techniques, with the sixth approach being the direct approach I devised prior. This was intended to be as objective a study as possible, so I did not inform the males or females of the experiment until results were achieved. Nor did I direct the coupling, so any of the males could approach any of the females and vice versa, which highlighted an interesting anomaly in male to female interactions. The acquisition phase of the experiment lasted 10 days. I coaxed some of social events within which these interactions occurred, but only in order to provide the opportunity for them to occur in the first place. Results of acquisition phase: Pickup lines, one liners, and humor are ineffective in a cold approach. Neg-ing (using negative superficial statements to subvert self-esteem), warm introductions (using a friend or familiar counterpart to initiate approach), and the direct method succeed in acquisition. Outlier: Neg-ing seems to work only when the female has started the introduction through non-verbal communication of her attraction.

The acquisition phase produced three pairings for the enchantment phase. In this phase common cultural myths and illogical sentimentality did all the work. It appeared all the females were primed for this stage as any demonstration of amorous intent by the males, no matter whether real or perceived, was taken as such and further reinforced the pairing. Despite intentional introduction of negative variables introduced in this phase, the females appeared inoculated of reality. This phase was purposefully stretched to 28 days. The reasoning was based on preliminary research stipulating that it take 28 days to form a autonomic habit. With the females showing signs of subconscious autonomic behavior in favor of this phase of the experiment extending its duration ensured the transition into phase three wasn't based on outside variables.

All three pairings survived and thrived in the enchantment phase, so the sustainability phase commenced. It was during this phase that the opportunity for coitus was allowed to develop. Prior, close and careful chaperoning and observation was required to protect the rigor of the experiment. When permitted all three pairings explored the opportunity for intimacy almost immediately. Interesting observation: all three pairs performed coitus the first time at almost the same hour on the same day. Unable to demonstrate causality for said synchronization likely due to sample size, but interesting none the less.

The sustainability phase I based on the methodology I encountered while at the military academy. The best way to unite strangers is a common enemy, but first you need to strip them of their individual identity. As coitus occurred with more regularity the individual personalities of the members of each pair began to converge. Tastes, likes, dislikes, sleeping schedules, even fluctuations in weight and emotional stability with menstrual cycles all affected the pair as a whole without regard for the individual. Additionally, the more time the pairs spent together as a group the more similar they became in their psychological states. After 21 days of stage three, the argument could be made that the experiment was no longer dealing with six individuals but instead three comprised of melded female and male psychology. Part two of the sustainability stage came with the introduction of a common enemy. At first the intention was to provided an individual threat to each pair, but as the experiment progressed one threat to one half of each pair seemed more fitting, as this would provoke a psychological rift within the new whole comprised of one male and one female. To do this the three females that did not get paired in phase one were reintroduced into the experiment. While still planning the proper environment to introduce these females as threats the intended results occurred organically. After 21 days, two of the pairs were split and only one survived stage three.

The results of this experiment satisfied my curiosity and entertained me for almost one year. I enjoyed the process greatly, but then returned to my hunt and used these results to my advantage. Further study and experimentation continued while I attended university but due to pesky class schedules and bureaucratic rigidity the experiments were sporadic and less scientific in their rigor.
