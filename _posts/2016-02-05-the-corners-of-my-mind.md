Playing with computers and solving problems I get little whispers of happiness but they're always fleeting. I feel like a junkie running from one situation to the other trying to get my fix. It's the silence in between fixes that always gets me; the ramblings from the corners of my mind.

I can feel the weight of age on my shoulders with the crushing force of disappointment on my chest, I can hardly breathe.

What is a life worth living?

My mind bears the scars of constant threats to its sanity and my survival. These scars are not liabilities that should be carefully navigated around and treated as brain damage. These scars are my armor, my shield, the infrastructure that holds dearly the potential of a great future. I survived, but I want more than to be a survivor, that is too common a goal for the pain I suffered and my ambitions. The scars of my survival are the foundation of greatness.

I've survived the bad days and try to act normal during the good days. I just hope I can string together enough good ones to make a living...
