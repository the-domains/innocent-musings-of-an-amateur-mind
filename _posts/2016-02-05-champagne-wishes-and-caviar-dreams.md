Watching the news, reading the papers, and seeing what could be called humans, if only for lack of a better word descriptive of their semblance to encyclopedic references. Encrusted in the smoldering remnants of what this ironically blind species considered the pinnacle of nature whilst blissfully ignoring the evolutionary dead end sign next to the geologically fresh crater of the previous proprietors, and I humbly realize that my fellow mammals, or hairless monkeys, as I like to call ourselves, that drafted that rallying cry, "home of the free, land of the brave.", that every mass of peoples in the past, in one mutation or another, has adopted, were either unbelievably naïve or nonchalantly attempting to discredit evolution as his fellow man missed the irony in the signs of the coming end.
