Growing up I always felt different. It was obvious to me that I didn't fit in, despite my endless attempts to pretend to. Impostor syndrome, they call it, or so I read. Not sure if that's because of my time spent away for normal social interactions with the humans or I'm just the result of an electrochemical physiological imbalance due to abhorrent genetic expressions. Truth is I've felt this way every day of my life.

Then I started pretending to be an entrepreneur. Being amongst the misfits seemed like the place I should belong, but my syndrome persisted. These misfits were too smart, too creative, too visionary, and I a lonely pauper in meager hopes the tunic didn't slip from my white-knuckled grip to reveal the impostor before them. I don't generally get nervous in public, paranoid, but not nervous. I now realize this paranoia is not the fear of pursuit or entrapment, but the fear of discovery. I feel like I don't belong, so I protect myself any way I can to avoid being discovered.

I see others succeed where I've failed and upon introspection understand that I am not jealous, I am nervous. I am nervous that the success of those around me shines a spotlight on my lack of achievement and outs me as the undeserving misanthrope that should scurry away to its cave. It's not easy being green, it's been said. Neither is being an outsider pretending to be human, I say.
