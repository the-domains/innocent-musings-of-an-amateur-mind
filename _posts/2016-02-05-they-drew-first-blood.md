Endless hospital halls and the pervasive smell of sanitizer were staples of the memories of my childhood. I could not shake the feeling that I had missed some essential part of life, or maybe I just didn't want to believe that this was all life was. I returned to Honduras changed; pain had forced me to grow up faster than even I wanted to, despite its advantages in dealing with my situation. 

I lied in my bedroom staring at the strange walls that surrounded me, although years passed before I ever felt comfortable in that room, I questioned what my next step would be. I had spent so much time in hospitals I was unsure how exactly to survive outside of them, I needed data. Once more, the questioned that haunted me from the first day of reason came to mind, Why/How?

In an event, that had ramifications I didn't realize until I reached my late 20's, I lost the only friend I had in Honduras. The details are tenable, but basically a girl came between us and the result was, as predictable as the next morning's sunrise, our friendship set asunder. History is replete with this motif and it seemed I was not an exception. What came next surprised even myself.

In a daze from a mixture of relentless introspection and insomnia I decided that my next step required an extreme change of environment. Engrossed in that thought I stared at the TV as it cycled images of John Rambo laying waste to his enemies. In a stutter of slow motion flashes I had my answer; I would enlist at a military academy. I scrambled to the computer and smirked at the sound of the modem. I loved that noise because of what it represented, just how a 16 year old is infatuated with his driver's permit; to me it represented freedom. My research narrowed the options, just as the sun rose and lit my bedroom I had made my decision. I would attend Culver Military Academy.

A few obstacles stood in my way, but like the soldier I planned to become I had to adapt and overcome. I wanted to test the place out just in case this seemingly brilliant decision was misled. I discovered they had a summer program I could attend, but first I had to convince my mother, knowing she would submit my father into agreement. Being understandably cautious of the very ground I stepped on, I would have to convince my mother in such a way as if it were her idea. A few calls and I found out relatives from San Pedro Sula had actually attended the summer program and were planning on doing so again. I was able to manipulate the situation through a friendly cousin to get that information to my mother. A couple weeks after, in my apparently depressed and friendless state, she mentioned Culver and how perhaps I might be interested in going. Less than 24 hours later the paperwork was filled and ready for their approval, in a haste I got my parents to sign off before they solidified any doubts.

My first summer at Culver was awesome! I joined aviation B squadron and learned the basics of flight, which in the later years resulted in my pilot's license. My second summer was cut short less than a month into it because I started showing signs of chronic fatigue and malaise; my remission lasted one year, back to the hospital I went.

This time was different, I not only had to deal with the ITP, but my leg became a problem again. I spent the next six months at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester as the doctors struggled once more to get my platelet counts up and the ITP back into remission, and then back to the Miami Children's Hospital. It seems the multiple surgeries and months in cast did not properly heal the bone and it warped under the pressure. This required major reconstructive surgery, along with a metal plate and six screws. In total I lost another two years of my life, had to learn to walk for the now fourth time in my life, and begrudgingly readjust my reality from the fleeting thoughts of a military career. I had constant dreams of Rambo in a video loop saying, "they drew first blood..."

As soon as I got out, I began my campaign to return, not just for the summer program, but for the military academy as well. I succeeded in my efforts and returned to Culver. I joined Battery C and had honestly failed to realize, up to that point, how insane boys that age really are; pubescent hormones are incredibly powerful drugs. My time at Culver cemented a lot of my view of the world and its ruling hominid class. It also taught me that no matter how much I think I know when it comes to the opposite sex, I am, and I can say this confidently, wrong! In those scarce moments when I was not wrong I was rightfully penalized by a staple of the Culver system, the ban on PDA. (Public Displays of Affection). TAC officers seemed to be ready to jump out of any bush at a moment's notice to charge me with PDA, of which resulted in countless tours (marching for one hour in full gear). It was during one of those Sunday tours that a young German approached me. He introduced himself as PFC (Private First Class) Bartel from Infantry B; and asked how exactly this "thing" worked. I explained that those proctoring the completion of tours stayed in Main Guard and that we were to march from the entrance of Main Guard to the flag poles and back to complete as many tours as possible. We talked as we marched and enjoyed each other's company in what was an unbelievably tedious task, but this was better than my previous punishments, so the marching continued. My friendship with Bartel grew as we shared stories of our platoon's escapades and buzz (gossip) about the senior officers.

I finished my junior year and decided to return briefly to Honduras, my parents were displeased with my absence and unwillingness to return for prior holidays so I had to acquiesce. The day I landed in Honduras everything was so different, almost unrecognizable; I barely recognized my parents, much less my sisters whom at this point I knew less about than most of the other humans that surrounded me. Equally, they barely recognized me, not only was I in uniform, but I had grown over 10 inches to, a height that seemed rather average at Culver, 6'4″. Once their shock subsided they hugged me as I tried my best to feign emotion and add range to my monotone monosyllabic responses.

Pleasantries exchanged, I lifted my gear when I noticed a skulking body at the entrance; Francisco. He asked how I was and if I wanted to ride with him back to my house, I had never seen that much hesitation in his demeanor; it made me suspicious. My curiosity bested me and I agreed to join him. In the car ride he was apologetic in his tone and despite a brief stop at the mall to see his female friends the expressed purpose of the trip was to rekindle our friendship.

Two weeks in Honduras and I discovered I could no longer return to the academy because of my health; that ended my dreams of an illustrious military career. My transition back to civilian life was not an easy one, it took me months to get used to the lack of reveille at dawn and TAPS at lights out. Pain has been my companion throughout my life and I have learned from it, but it pales to what I've learned from my interactions with the hominids in my shifting environment; if you ask me, they drew first blood...
