...then in one night of insomnia and scrambled thoughts, I was annoyed by all the lights in my bedroom. The years of inane hoarding of portals to my technological proclivities had finally come back to assault my senses. Awash in blinking status lights I arose groggy and irritated in a desperate pursuit of the greatest nerd tool of all, electrical tape. I attacked the photonic emitters mercilessly and with efficiency rarely seen outside elite military units. With the mission accomplished, darkness embraced me and my weary mind. A sardonic smirk across my face I lay down in a meager attempt at unconsciousness.

...the whirring...fans...the god damn fans. I was okay with the fan noise from the A/C. I've considered it the original white noise machine, but it is more than that. That fan signifies the oncoming artificial winter that I love so much; that fan is good, that fan is necessary for a civilized world. The fans of my custom gaming PC on the other hand are the work of evil. I suspect these men are members of the unholy alliance that shackled humanity with nefarious creations like the parking ticket, coach class seats, and my pet rock.

I had to stop the noise. I couldn't sleep. Those disposed of well mind and being may ask, "why not just turn off the computer?". I have many excuses, some of which may stretch the definition of copyrights, however they are that excuses. The point, at least in my mind, was that I needed that noise to stop. I dismantled my PC and spent the next six hours obsessively staring at the fans and their components. By the time I felt the heat from the glowing ball of fire in the sky I had enough adrenaline running through my veins to stay up for another 24 hours. Sleep was not an option.

That is until I started experiencing hallucinations and what felt like an out of body experience. At that point I realized sleep was necessary, only to wake up from what appeared to be a dream of me trying to go to sleep; I had fallen asleep hours before on the floor amongst the innards of my prized possession.

I scrambled to reassemble the PC, open up the web browser and commence my search for a professionally devised solution. Sound mats, isolation springs, liquid cooling, grounded self leveling suspension support struts, etcetera, etcetera. The list seemed eternal, yet none really solved the solution efficiently. The depression from the failure to solve the issue was soul crushing. I buried myself in bed in the fetal position hoping to erase the memory of the outside world.

In a half state between catatonic thought and impulsive twitching a thought slowly started forming. I remembered some work I had done while in college on satellite design, or computers in free-fall as my physics professor amusingly called them. That's it! heat-pipes! EUREKA!!!!
