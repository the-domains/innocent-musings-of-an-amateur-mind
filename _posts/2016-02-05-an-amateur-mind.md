My life has been a continually rolling series of failures, fuck ups, and hospital beds. This definitely isn't an instruction guide for happiness nor success, rather a somewhat shitty recounting of how I survived some of it and fucked up the rest.

I once read, "fortune favors the prepared mind...", thinking to myself, that's me, prepared! I'm still awed at the unsettling ignorance of that thought.

Little did I know then; little do I know now. What I do know now, though, is the result of hard lessons learned first hand, a couple aggressive looking scars, and psychological damage rarely seen outside the minds of the criminally insane. So here I give unto to you, some innocent musings of an amateur mind...
